# Statistics Calculator
Hello! This is my Statistics Calculator project, where I've implemented a program to calculate mean, median, and mode of a list of integers in three different programming languages: C, OCaml, and Python. Each implementation follows a different programming paradigm to showcase my understanding of Procedural, Functional, and Object-Oriented programming.

Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of basic statistical calculations using three different approaches:

C (Procedural): I used a procedural approach to implement the calculations with functions and basic loops.

OCaml (Functional): I implemented the solution in OCaml using immutable data structures and higher-order functions like fold, map, and filter.

Python (Object-Oriented): I implemented the solution using classes and methods, encapsulating the calculations in an object-oriented manner.

Project Structure
The project is organized into three separate files, each containing the implementation in one of the three languages:

/statistics_project
    /statistics_c.c         # C implementation (procedural)
    /statistics_ocaml.ml    # OCaml implementation (functional)
    /statistics_python.py   # Python implementation (object-oriented)
What I Learned
In this project, I gained experience working with different programming paradigms:

Procedural Programming (C): I learned how to manage memory and use basic data structures (like arrays) in a low-level language. I also had to implement my own sorting and frequency counting algorithms.

Functional Programming (OCaml): I learned to embrace immutability and higher-order functions. OCaml's powerful list and functional operations (like fold and map) allowed me to write concise and expressive code.

Object-Oriented Programming (Python): I created a class to encapsulate the logic for calculating statistics, which taught me how to design and organize code using objects and methods.

Challenges Faced
While working on this project, I faced a few challenges:

In C, I had to manually handle memory and sort the array for median calculation, which was a bit tedious compared to the higher-level operations available in OCaml and Python.

OCaml's immutability and functional approach made me think differently about how I structure my code, especially since I had to avoid mutable state and side effects.

In Python, I had to ensure that my StatisticsCalculator class was flexible enough to handle different types of data and edge cases like empty lists.

Conclusion
This project was a great opportunity to practice implementing the same solution in different programming languages and paradigms. It helped me better understand how different approaches can be used to solve the same problem and the trade-offs involved in each paradigm.
